A widget (in form of a plugin) which shows stats about the site it is installed on
(eg. number of posts, users, etc.) and the other sites on a multisite network.
The widget could also be "live", with the stats updating once a minute, as a way for you to demo
REST API knowledge.

1. Determine WordPress site stats
  - Figure out multisite querying
2. Check REST endpoints (possibly register custom)
3. Populate class(es)
4. Register widget
5. AJAX call(s)

### Statistics to Display

- Number of pages
- Number of posts
- Number of users
- Categories/Tags (most posts per)
- Most popular post by comments
